![[y2mate.com - Talking Bitcoin With the Winklevosses  Disrupt SF 2013.mp3]]



Yeah, right. 2013 was the year that Bitcoin kind of crossed over from being the fascination of hackers, anarchists general skeptics of the global financial system as extends into something that's actually more broadly accepted by the mainstream public and by the financial community at large. So this year was the first year that we started.

Investments from VCs and Bitcoin related startups. And there was this incredible run-up in the price after the Cypress banking crisis. So today we're going to talk to a handful of Bitcoin enthusiast investors to get a sense of where the ecosystem is going. So maybe I'm going to start with you guys, um, bosses.

Um, so you went from, you went to ACU you, you, you accumulated what is probably one of the largest stakes in Bitcoin probably. Globally, like you have 1% of Bitcoin in circulation, so I'm kind of wondering how did that happen and what sparked your interest in it to begin with? Um, so we actually kind of found Bitcoin totally unexpectedly.

We were on a vacation two summers ago in a visa and ran into a guy of all places, right. Um, not really expecting to come across a new investment, but we ran into a guy in, uh, from New York and we started talking about virtual. And we sort of got this feeling, um, right then as if like we had a time system at a time machine and it could have been like telephones back to the early days of the internet.

And the promise was just enormous that it can capture excitement right away. And how did you go about accumulating that stake and how long did it take you? When did you do it? I hope you weren't doing it earlier this year when it was like at $200. Thankfully not, um, some of it we bought on exchanges, some from directly.

It was kind of a scrappy process. Cause there wasn't a lot of liquidity, uh, or rather volume. Um, at the time it was a small market cap. So just through, um, you know, we just accumulated through certain different ways.  and, and how, I mean, how, if you were, if you could estimate your return on your Bitcoin holdings so far, what would it be?

You know, you lost money on it or definitely made money, but definitely made money. Can you say kind of hotline, good investment for us? I want to get too much into specifics, but, uh, we haven't sold anything. I haven't sold any. And then, and then some of it you made like a 10 X return on, right? That's probably fair.

Yeah. So I guess the question I have for the broader panel is Bitcoin has these kind of mysterious origins it's founded created by some guy, guys, women co collective, someone named Satoshi Nakamoto who disappeared and hasn't appeared since. When you were looking at the space and how do you get over the fact that no one knows really who created it?

Yeah, I don't really think about Tim Berners Lee. Every time I surf the worldwide web, I guess it doesn't matter to me. Uh, lots of people have examined the Bitcoin protocol spec, the encryption schemes under auditor, buying it and have come away with the realization that it's one of the most brilliant, uh, innovations, um, in, in the protocol and financial space that they have.

Um, so, so the underlying thing is sound, it's probably the case that Satoshi or the group that, uh, purported to be Satoshi probably holds somewhere around 10% of underlying Bitcoin, uh, making these guys look small time. Um, but that's okay. I mean, it's an incredible adventure for mankind. Um, if it works, what made you finally comfortable with it as well?

Made me comfortable. I mean, it took me yeah. A while to warm up to it. I just read through all the different pieces, you know, underlying Bitcoin, there's at least four different technologies that are sort of coming. Uh, to make it possible. And you know, as Paul Graham says, you got to live in the future. If you don't understand what's on the cutting edge and you're in the tech business, uh, then you're sort of missing out.

So I sort of force myself to learn about it. And underneath they've got a digital signature is using the very clever where you've got a peer to peer network. You have a distributed blockchain, which is this concept that every transaction, the history and record of every transaction is in everyone's wallet.

And then you've got this proof of work system to prevent double spending the application, which is great. So you've got four different, great concepts coming together, and I wanted to understand it just because I like technology. I like things that engage that enhanced personal freedom. This seems to be one of the cases that was doing both.

Uh, and so it took me a few months to dig through everything and get comfortable with, are there loopholes? What are the failure modes? What are the incentives and the motivations underneath? And I came away thinking that it was the most fundamental thing to come along since the underlying internet protocols like TCP IP.

And, and I think people think about Bitcoin incorrectly. They think about it currency year, about gold or about hoarding or speculation, or how much money do you make when really what it is. It is an API for program, book, cash and financial transactions. For the first time, the hackers in the audience have access to a protocol that allows them to program wills and escrow and notaries and, uh, payouts and dividends.

And, uh, you know, there are fun things you can do in crowd funding with Bitcoin that you just cannot do with normal cash. So this idea of programmable universal cash is what is really, really fun. I'd elaborate on that a little bit. Um, so one of the things about it, just, uh, you know, uh, the, uh, if you go to github.com/bitcoin front slash Bitcoin, you can get clone it and you can actually inspect the source.

You can look at it yourself, uh, and, uh, Satoshi wrote a paper on it. Um, and in general, you know, the validity of a mathematical theorem is not really a function of who did it. It's it can be independently checked. Uh, moreover Sitoshi actually has pretty good reason for remaining anonymous or else he'd be like hunted like Edward Snowden or something.

Um, this is something where, uh, every regular in the world is kind of, uh, after, uh, or at least in the U S is after Bitcoin. Now, um, their thing is that in terms of the fundamental computer science breakthrough here, uh, it's a solution to the Byzantine General's problem. Uh, and it's actually a breakthrough which can be used to turn a variety of things that we previously thought could only be done via centralized.

Into things that can now be done in a distributed fashion. So there are these all chains. Uh, I'm not saying any of them are the, you know, final answer or anything, but like name coin, that'd be like a distributed, you know, domain system, like a domain name system. Uh, and there's other things you can do, like a distributed public key infrastructure and so on.

So, um, technologically it's really just. Do you believe that Bitcoin is, is the end game in and of itself, or is it a predecessor to a, maybe a future math based currency that doesn't have some of the limitations like that, that 50%? Yeah. Th th the first of all, the 50% of tech limitations are far less than people make it out to be there's a lot, even if you say to be fair.

I mean, if, if, just to explain it, like the 50% attack means that if you control more than 50% of the nodes, The Bitcoin network, right? It can destroy. There's still not a lot. You can do you, can't just sort of, the current can object future transactions, but you can't go back and change past transactions.

And your incentives at that point are actually more to just mine, more Bitcoin and make money for yourself rather than to destroy it. Right. So there's a lot of, I mean, it's a very complicated topic. You cannot get educated in Bitcoin listening to this. It's like, if you're starting here, try something else, go, go read Bitcoin for dummies, but take.

But because if you were in 1995, either stand how TCP IP worked or how the world web was going to work, you were really missing out. Take the time. Yeah. Other thing is with respect to the 51% attack that would lead to a fork in the blockchain and effectively like multiple currencies kind of coexisting, which should potentially have some issues.

Uh, you could imagine China, you know, at some point in 2016 and Bitcoin has risen exponentially and they decided that they're going to turn a significant fraction of their semiconductor manufacturing over to, you know, controlling, you know, a lot of mining capability. That's. But in terms of, you know, the son of Bitcoin, like Bitcoin 2.0, that could replace it.

I actually think that it's going to be augmentations to Bitcoin. Right. Um, if you think about an HTP is actually a stateless protocol, but we've built all this stateful stuff on top of it, like, you know, cookies and then eventually like web apps and whatnot. So you don't actually think about that. You can actually go and log in and people, uh, have, have built all the stateful stuff on.

In the same way with Bitcoin, there's a few different things that people are working on. Now. One of them would be one of the most technological important developments since Bitcoin itself, which is something called zero coin. Uh, zero point basically turns Bitcoin into a truly anonymous currency where, uh, there's, it basically turns entire network into a mixer.

So you can teleport arbitrary amounts of money anywhere in the world. Uh, and right now that's not a practical. But eventually something like that will probably be incorporated into the blockchain. And that will be sort of to what we call it. Bitcoin. 1.0, what BitTorrent was to now? Yeah, I mean, when one thing that I hear a lot from investors is that Bitcoin is going to be, it's a binary outcome.

It's either going to be worth a lot or something. Yeah, that's right. Cause money, money is the ultimate network effect. So either it works and goes to infinity or it goes to zero. I don't think, I don't think the intermediate outcomes matter. So in that sense, asking someone today, have you made money in your Bitcoin?

They've only made money if they've sold it they've cashed out. They're still holding onto it. It's like it's like buying a hyper volatile option on a startup stuff. So what are the, what are the risk factors for you that you're thinking about? I think the biggest one is regulatory and government risk. Um, I think there is some small, uh, decryption encryption risks.

If it turns out there's a backdoor in the ripe MDs, uh, uh, you know, one of the protocols used underneath. Uh, but I think that the main one is essentially just the adoption curve. How long will it take to adopt? Because network effects need a tipping point. The established entrenched dogma of how money is supposed to work is very, very strong.

That tipping point could be two years out. It could be 20 years out. It could be 200 years out. Yeah. Speaking of regulation, I that's something I wanted to ask most of you about, um, you were recently subpoenaed, um, and New York regulators are kind of looking at how to, you know, understand Bitcoin, how to manage it.

And so what's going on with that? Um, so I mean, basically it looks, you know, from our standpoint to be a fact finding, um, discussion, and I think, you know, we've always been sort of welcoming of healthy regulation. I think that, um, it helps erase a lot of the uncertain. Out there with, uh, especially thanking relationships with startups.

Um, a lot of the banks I think are unclear. Uh, should we sort of bank these big points, startups and, um, what do we need to do to be compliant? Um, our, our view has always been that when you're dealing with whether it's Bitcoin or money, that the sort of the regulation KYC know your customers and L anti money laundering should be really treated, uh, identical across the board, whether it's Bitcoin or, or us dollars or something else.

Um, we're sort of all in favor of healthy regulation. Um, and I think that those discussions are happening now and as they progress, we'll get sort of more certainty of where things are going. And a lot of people potentially are on the sidelines with respect to investment or whether they want to start a company will enter into the, uh, the Bitcoin world.

Yeah. And you're also trying to start an ETF, a Bitcoin ETF. Right. So what, and that's also being, that's also under review as well, right? That's correct. And there, there are some, I mean, there are other investors out there who are looking at and saying, man, like this can take years to figure out years for New York regulators to approve a Bitcoin ETF.

Uh, only the sec knows that, answer the question. Okay. Um, so I wanted to talk about the startup ecosystem. So when, when we saw that run up to that peak high price earlier this year, we started seeing a lot of funding rounds. I mean the biggest one that I can think of right now is probably, you know, Coinbase.

Where are all these startups now, and for you as a masters, what what's an attractive place to go? Is it in wallets? Is it an exchanges? Yeah. So I personally haven't done any Bitcoin startup investments outside of just leverage plays on Bitcoin itself. The reason is if you look at the total value of all the Bitcoin ecosystem retina, it's about a billion and a half dollars.

Yeah. So if you have a company that shows up and it stays at a post-money of 30 million, you're basically betting that that company is going to capture 2% of all the value in the Bitcoin ecosystem over time. Otherwise you're better off investing in. Well itself. So you always have to look at the opportunity cost of investing in Bitcoin itself and investing in Bitcoin itself is not some, uh, you know, anti ecosystem thing.

Rather, what you're doing is you're allocating your money across the entire ecosystem, and you're creating incentive for all the startups, including the ones that might be in Russia or France, or just in someone's backyard, because they're all motivated by the price of Bitcoin. It's just like when the price of oil goes up, you buy oil, what happens?

The oil companies go drill more or they go extract shale and so on. So you just create incentive for the whole year. So in most cases, I think it's just better. You start off by buying the Bitcoin. If you're interested in it, it's an extremely high risk investment. So you would put a very, very small percentage into it.

And then after that, if you find a great startup to invest in, you can sort of play with a little bit of money on the edge, you know, one cynical point of view that the venture capital community, right. And that's probably by buying Bitcoin. Uh, with their own accounts and then investing the LPs money into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

But that's also because as a, as a VC, you can't call up your investors and say, oh, by the way, I just wrote a check your check for your money into buying Bitcoin. You're not supposed to go buy currency. And it's kind of viewed as that right now. Although if the LPs have their underlying GPS buying a Bitcoin stocks, they should also be holding some Bitcoin to bet on the broader ecosystem.

Um, personally, I think the most interesting plays are the exchanges because they actually have a built in network effect, whereas everything else in Bitcoin resistant. Um, and some concept of a simple local mobile wallet, um, that is usable by the average human, because Bitcoin is still too difficult to obtain transact and secure for the average person at what threshold does the market cap of Bitcoin become interesting enough to invest in a startup because startups around it to get there.

You know, when it kind of hits the three, $5 billion range at that point, you're probably going to be looking at you going to be balancing your portfolio as much into Bitcoin startups as you're into Bitcoin. But remember the Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to resist centralization. And one of the dirty secrets of Silicon valley is that our big moneymakers are all monopolies in their ecosystems and Bitcoin is designed to resist monopolization.

Um, so it's hard to imagine how any single Bitcoin related startup captures a huge chunk of the ecosystem. You can, you can elaborate on that, but thinking of at least three categories of Bitcoin investments, uh, mining, uh, direct purchase of Bitcoin, and then investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and one can conceptualize mining.

The attempt to purchase Bitcoin below market price with some probability, with high risk in general, um, then you can just buy Bitcoin and market price itself. And finally you can invest in the ecosystem and that can be conceptualized as among other things investing in increasing the price. And you can actually calculate this as a portfolio strategy where, you know, you do your Lagrandes multipliers or whatever, and you get your coat.

And if you have large enough holdings, uh, then it's worth investing some fraction in boosting the price. And actually it boils down to your CAC, your cost of customer acquisition, how efficiently the companies you're investing in can get more users into Bitcoin and thereby drive up the price. Assuming that each user holds a Bitcoin balance and becomes a, you know, a Bitcoin user, um, in terms of the appreciation of Bitcoin currently, it's, you know, around a hundred something, you know, Um, where could it eventually go?

Uh, so unlike the mini start-ups, you actually can potentially calculate this. I mean, you can do market cap, estimations. Um, you know, if Bitcoin gets to a thousand dollars, like all Bitcoin, all time is 21 million, so let's just take that number. So be 21 billion. If we mind everything, uh, if it got to $10,000, it'd be 210 billion, still less than the market cap of existing publicly traded.

Um, if you go up to a hundred thousand, now you're talking about something that's on the level of gold, like 2.1 trillion worldwide. Uh, you go up one more order of magnitude to a, a million dollars for BTC and you're talking us GDP and then $3 million from BTC. You're talking world GDP. So that's what winning looks like.

But as surreal as that sounds, that's a 30,000 X growth over where it is. Now when Peter teal invested in Facebook, what scenarios are you imagining that what we'll do on outcome like that? There's a thing, uh, you know, in, in 2004, Peter, till invest in that and got 10% at 5 million valuation. And, you know, when it IPO, that was about a 10, 15,000 X return.

So there is a comparable historical precedent in the sense of, if you invest early in it, You actually can get that level of return that said no one should invest with an expectation. No only should be for that expectation. But I'm just saying, and what is the, what is the global economic picture look like in a world that drives me?

Bitcoin has a lot of advantages, for example, over gold, except that Goldman around a lot longer. So all the things that gold does Bitcoin kind of does better. Um, but everybody believes in gold people who've been using gold for thousands of years. Gold is just a speculative store of value. It actually has very little intrinsic value.

Its intrinsic base probably around 200 bucks per ounce. And then the rest is all split. Um, and so if, if Bitcoin really replaces or comes alongside gold as a speculative store of value, it's going to be worth thousands of times what it is worth today. So that's actually a very simple one. Yeah. Okay.

That's right. And, you know, so you ask what scenarios would result in that. So, uh, th the reason that, you know, the Cypress thing drove up the price of Bitcoin just yesterday, for example, Poland announced seizure of half the, you know, the pensions in the country just by Fiat. Right. And, uh, what you can do is, you know, with the mortgage crisis, there was a failure to.

The possibility of tail risk scenarios, right? Like unlikely events with extremely negative outcomes. So let's say that a tail risk scenario, whatever country you live in is a bail-in where some fraction of your savings is expropriated. Just like in Cyprus. In fact, there's a document, you know, you can see the federal reserve and the bank of England have actually published a document on GCFS, globally, significant financial institutions, which they talk about the bail-in procedure and what fractions they'll do for various countries.

So let's say that a bail-in may happen at some point. Then what you can do is you can say. Um, you know, if you just have cash in the bank that is vulnerable to a command line sort of thing, like they didn't Cypress where they just, you know, expropriate bank accounts. If you have cash under the mattresses, they can't just get it with a command line, but, you know, they can obviously, you know, print currency and so on.

If you have gold, well, you know, you can't easily carry a gold brick through the TSA is, you know, a screening process and you can't go to Starbucks and chip off a gold flake and use as a negotiable. Um, but if you have Bitcoin that actually defeats all capital controls, you can actually cross a national border with a billion dollar skin, Bitcoin entirely in your head.

How do you, how do you store your whole, you have a very complicated system for storing? Well, so I just want to add Elijah was saying, um, in July, the only country in the world were actually Bitcoin client downloads increased and they doubled was in Argentina. And the inflation rate right now is about 25%.

At least that's what they. You know, what's being reported. And so basically people for trying to convert their paces into Bitcoin. And if you look@thequoteonlikelocalbitcoins.com, the there's a huge, um, Delta between, uh, the price of, uh, buying Bitcoins locally in Argentina than, um, on, on the exchanges. So, uh, it's an interesting sort of development and sort of the capital controls, just like Elijah was saying, you know, the metal detectors trying to pick up the gold bars or the pace of symphony.

Um, don't really work for Bitcoin and it's a fascinating development in that part of the world. Um, but in respect to storing, we actually basically put it on a wallets and cold storage on USB sticks in, uh, banks across the country. And we probably, how many banks are storing all of your things more than two.

Yeah. I'm assuming there's some secret twin code where they both have internet. Advantageous. It's actually safer than gold because then you need a password for the USB. So you've got to break into a bank and then break a password. So it's actually better than just playing that that's that is not for the faint of heart.

If you use a bad passphrase or a bad seed, your Bitcoin will get stolen. There's a lot of the, the returns to hacking or no, but I ran a fun experiment with some friends, which is, uh, you can create Bitcoin wallets entirely as bricks. User generated there. Might've simple passphrases. Yeah. And then you generate your keys from that and you put money in there.

Um, so we basically said, Hey, is it worth going into the blockchain? And then mining the entire thing for simple passphrase wallets and trying to see if you can just find money lying around. And then before you go to that effort, you just say, Hey, let's see if somebody else is doing it. So we just created a wallet out of hello world and we dropped it into the blockchain.

It was empty and hour. Wow, but there's somebody out there already mining the blockchain for simple paths, right? Both leads with that said, I mean like one of the biggest things about Bitcoin is Bitcoin. You can conceptualize it as, uh, you know, Bitcoin is to money. What email is to physical mail, right?

Like, just like with email, if anyone has your public email address, they can send you money. And only you with your private email password can send it out in the same way. Bitcoin, anyone who has your public Bitcoin address can send you money at anyone who, and only you who have your private Bitcoin key can send.

So you can actually bring all the BTC onto, um, you know, your local computer and then transfer it and then print out a private key, uh, as long as, um, you've seen that change to the blockchain, that thing can be on like a fortune cookies. Piece of paper or hidden in a bunch of different ways. So in many ways it's much more secure than any other bank account because banks don't even know you have the money.

So I think that that analogy, that email is really important because when email was first showing up, there are a lot of analogies to postal mail, and we sort of thought that it would replace postal mail and kind of stop there. But obviously we use email in unimaginable ways today. So I think in the same way, it's important not to just think about Bitcoin as a replacement for cash or gold or something that works alongside that.

It's the think of it as programmable money. And we just cannot even imagine what it will be used for. If there was an AI and artificial intelligence existed today, it would not work in dollars. It would work in Bitcoin. You can have self-contained pieces of code that live in the cloud that never activate on the internet for years, that can hold Bitcoin in there and they can transact and money when they wake up and go back to sleep.

Um, you know, you could do a crowdfunding campaign where we could all do a kitchen. And then the shareholders and the Kickstarter. In other words, the people who have contributed get to vote to release money as different milestones are hit. You can do that in Bitcoin. It's all programmable in the protocol.

It has a built in scripting language that lets you do all kinds of things that today we devote 20% of the economy for what wall street does, can be done in code by a Bitcoin hate to tell wall street. But you know, let's not clue them in too fast program wills, escrows trusts, notaries, you know, revokable chargebacks proofs of.

Uh, uh, you know, like intellectual property enforcement. So Toshi dice is an interesting company and no one really pays attention to this, but this guy, he took a company public, which was a Bitcoin sort of gambling site. He took it public. He sold shares anonymously entirely in Bitcoin to anonymous shareholders, no regulators, no registration, no costs, no bankers.

He paid dividends. And then when the company got sold, he actually paid them their return. And then some, these people made money in the Bitcoin investment that was run completely off the normal financial grid, uh, with, uh, normal. Yeah. I mean, it's, you're still investing it. You're just saying I'm not buying Bitcoin.

That's how I invested it. It's a small amount to me. It's much more about the personal freedoms and the program book cash part than it is about currency or making money. I would just add to what a novel was saying about programmable money. Here's like a couple of applications that you could envision so fast forward, five years or something.

And there's the Uber, Google Tesla merger of dispatching and automatic cars. And, and. It's built into Tesla cars and you've got them running on the freeway and one car, you know, you want to accelerate and you pay in Bitcoin automatically to the cars in front of you, a passing price, right. She can just boom, like this and just go through the fascinating, they just gotta be anonymous.

They gotta be cash because if you're doing credit, you can charge back as soon as you pass them. Right. So you're very, you're very confident in the security of the Bitcoin protocol itself. But if you look at the history of the startups that have surrounded it, there there's just been a litany. Yeah. I mean, security issues with exchanges, liquidity problems, but it's a different in a bank robbery versus being able to counterfeit currency.

Right? So the former is a function of the bank that is a particular startup and the ladder actually being able to do significant double spending has not happened. It's it's part easier and cheaper to counterfeit hundred dollar bills. And as the counterfeit Bitcoin w when, uh, Tyler and I were sort of trying to get her wrap our heads around it, um, one of the things, uh, you know, I've heard a lot from like Nepal saying, like, this is highly speculative and it is, yeah.

As investors, you can't just pick up the phone and talk to the founder. Right. Cause we don't know who he is. And um, it's, it's sort of, you know, then what we did is basically go to all sort of the people in Bitcoin or people who are, um, highly fascinated with like these guys. Um, and it's hard to wrap your mind around like all aspects of it.

But as investors we felt like it was just the, the promise and potential is just way too large that we couldn't afford to not be a part of it. It is highly speculative, but at the same time, like if you think of it as programming will money or cash or email of cash, um, we're literally at the early days of this like financial internet, which is unbelievable.

So as, as you're setting up this ETF, what are you, what's your advice to just regular retail investors? Like how do they play in Bitcoin? Um, I mean, I think that sort of, that was one of our, our ideas is sort of bringing retail investors to Bitcoin and allowing them to have at least the investment exposure, because what we noticed, um, and tell her.

You know, elaborate, but there's so many sort of hoops, fire and pain points and sort of accumulating Bitcoin and buying it that we wanted to make it, uh, more accessible to the average viewer in, in certain investors, can't just buy Bitcoin mutual funds, pension funds, 401ks. So just like VCs are having trouble buying Bitcoin.

They have to invest in companies with ETF. Um, we open up Bitcoin into a whole new world. Cool. And with that, we have to close up the panel. Thank you so much. Thank you.
